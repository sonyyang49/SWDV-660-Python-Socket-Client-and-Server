# SWDV-660-Python-Socket-Client-and-Server
Week 4 Assignment

## Instructions:  

1. Download the github repository to a location that you can access.  

2. Open two command line terminals.  

3. In both terminals, go ahead and change the current directory to the location of the downloaded repository. 
   ex: cd "C:\Users\Sony\Documents\Github\MyAssignment\

4. In one terminal, we can establish the server connection by running the Server.py file via Python.  
   ex:   python Server.py
   
5.  On the other terminal, we will run the client connection by running the Client.py file via Python. 

6. Once the connection on the client side is established, you will start seeing some acknowledgements.  On the client side, please type in  a random string.  

7. The server will receive the string and will send you 'Hi', if the string you sent was 'Hello'.  Otherwise, the server will send a string of 'Goodbye'.  

8.  You can close the connection on the client side by typing 'q'.
